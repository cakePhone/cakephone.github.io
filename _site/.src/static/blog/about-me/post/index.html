<h1>A little about myself</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Miguel Santos, a 18 year old Portuguese self-taught web developer.
I work mainly with Svelte (used for this website) and NextJS. Backend is not
a strong point and I've been learning Go and C. I've experimented with Rust,
Kotlin and even Python! I can say I love tinkering around with different programming
languages feeling around for what I find more intuitive to me.</p>
<p>I first started coding at the age of 14 when I got invited to an
internship at a start-up named &quot;Lovys&quot;. But before joining, I was
challenged to work with Python and learn the basics of coding. I started
by taking a free Harvard course, <a href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science">CS50</a>. I couldn't finish it, but I learnt a lot. In that internship, I learnt
a bit more of Python, working with APIs and a small library known by all,
turtle. And hey! That's me while at it!</p>

<h2>What got me into coding?</h2>
<p>I've always been keen on computers, my first electronic device was an
android tablet when I was only 5-6 years old. I can't remember the exact
model, but I know that not soon after I managed to find ways of cracking
my favourite and fastest growing game at the time, Minecraft. In 5th grade
I made an attempt at joining a programming club, but due to it being
overcrowded, I had to leave and joined my friend on another club.</p>
<p>Later on, at the end of 9th grade, I joined the internship I wrote about
above. That was the true spark of my coding journey. All thanks to my
cousin that never gave up motivating me to continue working and improving.
Not just in coding, but also in studies.</p>
<h2>My personality</h2>
<p>I'm a very casual person around those I meet, especially with friends,
despite the initial interaction barrier being quite hard to break for me.
I work mainly alone, but I'm open to team work.</p>
<p>I'm very focused on my work, doing everything I set my mind to. My biggest
flaw is exactly the same thing: if I simply set my mind to not do
something, I won't do it. I do try to go around it and push through my own
lack of motivation for things I find useless or without meaning.</p>
